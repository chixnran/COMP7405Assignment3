# Assignment 3 
## UI
We try to build a simple browser-based GUI application with PyWebIO, which provides a series of imperative functions to obtain user input and output on the browser, turning the browser into a "rich text terminal".

## Installation

Stable version:

```bash
pip3 install -U pywebio
```

Development version:
```bash
pip3 install -U https://github.com/pywebio/PyWebIO/archive/dev-release.zip
```

**Prerequisites**: PyWebIO requires Python 3.5.2 or newer
